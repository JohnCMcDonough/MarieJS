## Synopsis

This project was created to help make writing MarieJS assembly easier. This project provides an alternative to the Java Marie Simulator. It also includes a rudimentary compiler that allows converting between a JavaScript-like language (nicknamed McDScript) and MarieJS assembly. The compiler has support for strings and arrays, however some higher level functions such as recursion are missing.

A demo version is available [here](https://johncmcdonough.github.io/MarieJS-demo)
